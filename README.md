1. Joachim Nock's [tutorial](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/view/writing-a-simple-c-kernel) was very helpful for immplementation purposes and building the kernel.

2. Arjun Sreedharan's Kernel development Series were used for understanding some concepts and some immplementation:
	i. [Kernel 101](http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel)
	ii. [Kernel 201](http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/99370248137/kernel-201-lets-write-a-kernel-with-keyboard)
 
3. Derek Molloy's [Writing a Linux Kernel Module](http://derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-1-introduction/) (beaglebone board series) did provide some additional insights.

4. Simple Keyboard map: keyboard.h - was taken directly from http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/keyboard.htm.
